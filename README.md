# Encriptador-Desencriptador

<p>This is an encriptor code solved with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It asks the user tu put a word or phrase into the text field, then encripts in a code and show you how will end up the encripted text, you have the option to copy that encription; also you can put that encription again in the text field to dencrypt the code into the word that the user previously typed down.<p>
  
 <p>As an addition there are some test codes that were my first attempt of the encription.</p>
